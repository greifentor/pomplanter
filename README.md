# pomplanter
A tool which is able to represent a POM project structure as a PlantUML component diagram.

The project has currently an implementation in go only, but a second one in java will follow to see the differences in both programming languages.

The tool creates a PlantUML output which displays any component and sub component of the passed POM file as a component in a component diagram. External dependencies and projects will not be displayed currently.
